# Sphere
 
> Sphere is an open-source social network developed with Spring Boot and React, built on a microservices architecture for scalability and modularity. Currently, the project is still under development, and I am continuously enhancing it by adding new features. This is my primary project, where I plan to focus my efforts on delivering ongoing improvements, aiming to make it a robust and innovative platform.
